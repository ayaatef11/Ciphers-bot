# 🔐 Cipher Bot – Classical & Modern Encryption Toolkit

Cipher Bot is a browser-based JavaScript application that demonstrates the implementation of classical and modern cryptographic algorithms for educational purposes.  
All encryption and decryption algorithms in this project are implemented **from scratch** without relying on external cryptographic libraries.

This repository is designed to help students and beginners understand how encryption algorithms work internally by providing clear, readable implementations.

## ✨ Supported Ciphers

### Classical Ciphers
- Caesar Cipher  
- Monoalphabetic Cipher  
- Vigenère Cipher (Auto-Key)  
- Playfair Cipher  
- Hill Cipher  
- Rail Fence Cipher  
- Permutation Cipher  
- Row Transposition Cipher  
- One-Time Pad (OTP)

### Modern Ciphers
- DES (Data Encryption Standard)  
- AES-128 (Advanced Encryption Standard)  

Each cipher supports both encryption and decryption with proper key handling and validation.
